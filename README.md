# Making Discord Bots

## Overview
This repository provides a **step-by-step guide** to creating and deploying **Discord Bots** using **Python**. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this documentation will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your development environment to deploying your bot on a server. The project uses the **discord.py** library and demonstrates how to configure, customize, and host your bot.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Guide**: Detailed instructions for creating and deploying Discord Bots.
- **Easy Setup**: Step-by-step process for setting up Python, configuring the bot, and deploying it.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Mac**.
- **Deployment Options**: Includes instructions for deploying your bot using **Replit** and monitoring it with **Freshworks**.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. If not, follow the installation instructions below:
  - **Windows**: Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).
  - **Linux**: Run `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip`.
  - **Mac**: Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).

## Getting Started
### Stage 1: Setup
1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Place all files in a single folder.

### Stage 2: Create a Discord Bot
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/).
2. Create a new application and name it.
3. Navigate to the **Bot** section and click **Add Bot**.
4. Configure bot permissions and generate an **OAuth2 URL**.
5. Copy the bot token for later use.

### Stage 3: Configure the Bot
1. Open the `discord-bot.py` file.
2. Replace `Paste bot token here` with your bot token.
3. Set your bot's prefix (e.g., `!`) in the configuration.
4. Save the file.

### Stage 4: Deploy on Replit
1. Go to [Replit](https://www.replit.com).
2. Create a new **Repl** and upload the project files (excluding `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the program and copy the generated URL.

### Stage 5: Monitor Your Bot
1. Use [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/) to monitor your bot's uptime.
2. Add the bot's URL and configure monitoring settings.

### Stage 6: Add Bot to Your Server
1. Use the OAuth2 URL to add the bot to your Discord server.
2. Authorize the bot and verify its online status.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: Core programming language.
- **discord.py**: Library for interacting with the Discord API.
- **Replit**: Cloud-based IDE for deploying the bot.
- **Freshworks**: Monitoring tool for ensuring bot uptime.

## Screenshots
- **Bot Configuration**: Setting up permissions and tokens in the Discord Developer Portal.
- **Replit Deployment**: Running the bot on Replit and generating the URL.
- **Freshworks Dashboard**: Monitoring the bot's uptime and performance.
